# Backbone.js
## What it is
   - MVC framework
   - Structure to your JavaScript code

## What problem does it solve
   JavaScript has a history of being treated as a second-class citizen on web
   applications.

   Mostly used for "web 2.0" visual effects and occasional AJAX requests.

   Rarely used by people who really understood the language. Seen as a
   toy-language. (we've all been there)

   Snippets spread through the codebase make it unmaintanable, error-prone mess.

   Inline snippets make logic non-reusable, hard to debug and troubleshoot.

   Separate behaviour from content (unobtrusive), in the same way that CSS
   separates presentation from content.
